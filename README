Documentation is docs directory.

Please note that trying to run this project in it's current implementation will *not* work.
This application is undergoing a lot of development and until further notice, all of the Git commits
are just for organizational purposes on my end. A real version of this project will be released within
a ~week. Until then, don't expect any of this stuff to work or really make much sense.
